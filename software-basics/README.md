# First  Steps

This is the FCC Starterkit, a series of lessons for getting physicists working confidently with FCC data and software.
The lessons are best approached one after the other, as most lessons build on the knowledge gained from the previous ones.

If you have any problems or questions, you can [send an email to `fcc-experiments-sw-dev@cern.ch`](mailto:fcc-experiments-sw-dev@cern.ch).

:::{admonition} Prerequisites
:class: prereq

Before starting, you should be familiar with using a shell, like `bash`, and with programming in Python.

The [analysis essentials course](https://hsf-training.github.io/analysis-essentials/) has an introduction to these topics, as does the [Software Carpentry workshop](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/), which includes many other useful computing tools.
