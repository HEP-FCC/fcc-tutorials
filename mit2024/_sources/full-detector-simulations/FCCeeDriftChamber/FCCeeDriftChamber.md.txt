# FCCee: Full Simulation of IDEA Driftchamber

An updated implementation of the IDEA driftchamber for full simulations is under development. The old documentation (using FCCSW v0.16, pre-Key4hep ) can be found [here](https://github.com/HEP-FCC/fcc-tutorials/blob/v0.1.0/full-detector-simulations/FCCeeDriftChamber/FCCeeDriftChamber.md).
