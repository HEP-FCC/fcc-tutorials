    "For this tutorial we will consider the following **physics processes**:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   p p -> H -> 4 l\n",
    "-   p p -> Z/gamma Z/gamma -> 4 l\n",
    "\n",
    "Pythia can be configured to hadronize previously generated hard scattering in the form of Les Houches event files (.lhe),\n",
    "or generate the hard process itself and then run the parton shower and hadronization. **In either case, the FCCSW takes\n",
    "as input a Pythia8 configuration file** (.cmd), and does not need to know which approach was used. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this tutorial, we are going to run Pythia8 on previously produced LHE files (with [MG5_aMCatNLO](https://launchpad.net/mg5amcnlo)). Additional Pythia8\n",
    "configurations are present in ```Generation/data```. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following commands will run Pythia8 and Delphes and produce the relevant signal and background samples:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "./run fccrun.py Sim/SimDelphesInterface/options/PythiaDelphes_config.py --inputfile=Generation/data/Pythia_pp_h_4l.cmd --outputfile=pp_h_4l.root --nevents=1000\n",

    "The `--inputfile` , `--outputfile` and `--nevents` options simply overwrite parameters that are defined in the main\n",

    "Aside from I/O and number of events (which can be specified through command line),\n",
    "for most use cases as a user you won't need to apply any change to the configuration file.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the **sequence of modules** to be executed, and which **output collections** to be stored in the output tree, the following\n",
    "parameters can be specified via the configuration file:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `nEvents` --&gt; number\n",
    "    of events to be simulated\n",
    "-   `pythiaConfFile` --&gt;\n",

    "-   `out.filename` --&gt;\n",
    "    name of output file\n",

    "In this example, Delphes is run on the fly with the baseline FCC-hh detector configuration.\n",

    "------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "[Heppy](https://github.com/HEP-FCC/heppy) is a python framework suitable for analyzing the FCCSW output.\n",
    "\n",
    "First install HEPPY:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/HEP-FCC/heppy.git\n",
    "cd heppy\n",

    "Understand the configuration file for this **H->4l analysis**: `heppy/test/analysis_pp_hTo4l_simple_cfg.py`\n",
    "This is where **filters** on input collections and **event selection** are defined.\n",
    "The sequence is divided in two parts, a gen level analysis, and a reco level.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The **gen level analysis** simply filters interesting leptons (`gen_leptons`) and stores pT, eta in in flat tree (`gen_tree`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Have a look at the corresponding code in `heppy/analyzers/examples/hzz4l/HTo4lGenTreeProducer.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The **reco level analysis** first **selects isolated leptons** (`selected_muons`, `selected_electrons`), merges them into a single collection (`selected_leptons`),\n",
    "**builds Z candidates** (`zeds`) and finally **builds higgs candidates**  (`higgses`). After that an **event selection** is applied (`selection`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Open `heppy/analyzers/examples/hzz4l/selection.py` and understand the event selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally another flat tree is produced `HTo4lTreeProducer`.\n",
    "This tree contains contains all relevant information for the two reconstructed Z bosons, the Higgs, and the four associated leptons.\n",
    "For comparison, also the MC level counterparts of the reconstructed quantities are stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, when designing a new analysis, you will have to define:\n",
    "\n",
    "- a configuration file containing the analysis sequence\n",
    "- an event selection\n",
    "- one or several tree producer(s) where the variables to be stored in the output tree(s) are specified\n",
    "- optionally, new modules that are specific to your analysis (e.g. `LeptonicZedBuilder` here)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now run HEPPY:\n",
