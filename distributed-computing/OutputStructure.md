# Structure for /eos/experiment/fcc/prod

## Overview
FCC Monte Carlo productions will be handled by the DIRAC system and stored at CERN under

```
 /eos/experiment/fcc/prod/fcc
```

where `/eos/experiment/fcc/prod` is the mapped endpoint and `/fcc` is required to honour DIRAC request to start with `/<VO>`.
A hierarchical structure for the output files has been defined for an efficient use of this area.
The purpose of these pages is to describe such a structure.

Complete metadata will be available from DIRAC through the unique identifier `DiracProdID` discussed above.
