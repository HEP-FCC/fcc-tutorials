# Distributed computing

These pages provide - and dissect - examples of workflows to be run on distributed resources with the [DIRAC Interware system][dirac]
through [iLCDirac][ilcdirac], the extension developed by the Linear Collider community and used also by CALICE.

The procedure to be enabled to use the FCC resources through DIRAC is first described. Additional information about the use of
iLCDirac can be found in the [CLIC][wikiclic] and [ILC][wikiilc] dedicated Wiki pages.

Unless specified, in the rest of this section the word `DIRAC` refers to the `iLCDirac` extension introduced above.
