# Generators, Fast Simulation and Analysis


If you want to get started with generation and  analysis of fast-simulated
events, you're at the right place.

Fast simulation is currently supported through the Delphes approach. Support for the Papas approach, initially used for FCC-ee, is
discontinued.

An analysis ntuple will be produced with ROOT's RDataFrame, a simple modular event processing framework for high energy physics.

If you have any problems or questions, you can

[GitHub repository where these lessons are developed][fcc-tutorials-repo].
