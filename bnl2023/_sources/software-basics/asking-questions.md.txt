:::{admonition} Mailing lists
:class: callout

For FCC specific questions your best bet are the FCC mailing
list : `fcc-experiments-sw-devATSPAMNOTcern.ch`
A recent alternative to the mailing lists is the [Mattermost chat](https://mattermost.web.cern.ch/fccsw) having dedicated channels, and the [discourse forum](https://fccsw-forum.web.cern.ch)

For more general questions [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and
[Google](https://www.google.com) are good starting places.
